1. Preparing exercise data 
	1. Check Models/exercise.model.ts for holding the data 
		For the state we are only accpeting the predefined items
			public state?: 'completed' | 'cancelled' | null
			
	2. A service where we will manage all the exercises along with completed and cancelled 
		>ng g s Services/training
			Check the training.services.ts for more details in Services folder
			No need to put it in the providers array of the module since we are using providedIn root for the Inhectable
			Also created some dummy exercises for now
			Make the array private, provide a helper method to get the exercises. Make sure to return the new array rather than reference to the current array. 
			
	3. Use the dummy data above and use it in New Training component
		Inject the service and then assign the available exercises to the variable 
		Go to html and replace the hard coded exercises with dummy data using the ngFor loop
		
2. Setting exercise 
	Go to training.service.ts and a method to start exercise 
		this will set the exercise and then will emit the subject to tell the subscribers that the exercise has started
	Also setup completeExercise and cancelExercise methods 

3. Subscribe to start training event in training component 
	Code changes in training.component.ts and training.component.html 
	
4. We do not need to emit from new training any more so remove all relevant code
	Go to new-training.component.ts and overwrite the onStartTraining to utilize the training service
	Also, create the form to submit the selected training to the onStartTraining method 
	Display the exercise name and reset the progress
	On cancel training do not emit the event so remove trainingStopped event
