We are working with data. For this we'll use some services including authentication service. For now will fake the data. 

Inside src / app folder create following folders and files.  
	
	1. Models - check code for more details
		1. user.model.ts
		2. auth-data.model.ts
		
	2. Services - check code for more details 
		1. auth.service.ts 
			>ng g s Services/auth
			Imp: check use of spread operator which three dots .... It returns the new object rather than returning the reference to original object 
			To use the service, first we'll need to tell anugular about it.
				Also, this makes sure that we use the same instance of the service 
				
			go to app.module.ts and add it in providers array 
				providers: [AuthService]
				
			once provided then we can inject it where ever we need it. 
			
			
Other components that have a change 
	1. signup.component.ts
		Using the auth service register user
	
	2. login.component.ts
		Using the auth service login  
		Then we tell other parts of the app that we have logged in using RxJs observables/subject. 
			auth service import/define subject 
				import { Subject } from 'rxjs'; 
				hasUserLoggedInSubject : Subject<boolean> = new Subject<boolean>();
				
				and then on registerUser and login methods add 
					this.hasUserLoggedInSubject.next(true);
				and on logout method add 
					this.hasUserLoggedInSubject.next(false);
					
	3. SideNav & Header		
			Then we need to use the subject where we need to react to the change 
			Header and sideNav will show/hide navigation items per this subject
				Check both component and html for details. We'll subscribe and then will show/hide the nav items accordingly
