AngularFire And Fire Base
	AngularFire acts as a bridge between FireBase and the App. 
	It is an Observable-based "Data Streams" 
	
		Observable 
			Wraps Callback "Htttp Request"
			Invokes next(), error(), complete()
			This is streams of data 
			Can use operators e.g map (rxjs library)
		
		Observer
			has methodes next(), error(), complete()
	
	Go to 
	https://github.com/angular/angularfire 
	https://github.com/angular/angularfire/blob/master/docs/install-and-setup.md
		It has setup and sample usage information 
		
		>npm i firebase --save
		>npm i @angular/fire --save
			 
	Go to your Firebase console and then to your project and the click on project overview 
		Under get started click the WEB APP icon
			Register the app by providing the name "ng-fitness-tracker" click Register 
			It will give the info for all above 
			

			 
Add fire base specific config to the environment.ts file 
		/src/environments/environment.ts
		/src/environments/environment.prod.ts
		
		fireBaseCollectionNames: {
			availableExercises: "availableExercises"
		},
		firebase: {
			apiKey: '<your-key>',
			authDomain: '<your-project-authdomain>',
			databaseURL: '<your-database-URL>',
			projectId: '<your-project-id>',
			storageBucket: '<your-storage-bucket>',
			messagingSenderId: '<your-messaging-sender-id>',
			appId: '<your-app-id>',
			measurementId: '<your-measurement-id>'
		  }

		[IMPORTANT] My check ins will be with firebase blank entries
				

Setup @NgMdule for the AngularFireModule in app.module.ts
	import { AngularFireModule } from '@angular/fire/compat';
	import { AngularFirestoreModule } from '@angular/fire/compat/firestore';
	
	also import the environment file 
	import { environment } from '../environments/environment';
	
	and then add to the imports array. You'll need to execute a method AngularFireModule 
	AngularFireModule.initializeApp(environment.firebase)
	AngularFirestoreModule
	
Sample Fetching the data check "prj012FitnessTracker-firebase-config-json.txt"
